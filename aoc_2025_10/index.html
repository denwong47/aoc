<p>Just across the hall, you find a large factory. Fortunately, the Elves here have
plenty of time to decorate. Unfortunately, it’s because the factory machines are all
offline, and none of the Elves can figure out the initialization procedure.</p>
<p>The Elves do have the manual for the machines, but the section detailing the
initialization procedure was eaten by a Shiba Inu. All that remains of the manual
are some indicator light diagrams, button wiring schematics, and joltage
requirements for each machine.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<div class="example-wrap"><pre class="language-text"><code>[.##.] (3) (1,3) (2) (2,3) (0,2) (0,1) {3,5,4,7}
[...#.] (0,2,3,4) (2,3) (0,4) (0,1,2) (1,2,3,4) {7,5,12,7,2}
[.###.#] (0,1,2,3,4) (0,3,4) (0,1,2,4,5) (1,2) {10,11,11,5,10,5}</code></pre></div>
<p>The manual describes one machine per line. Each line contains a single indicator
light diagram in [square brackets], one or more button wiring schematics in
(parentheses), and joltage requirements in {curly braces}.</p>
<p>To start a machine, its indicator lights must match those shown in the diagram,
where . means off and # means on. The machine has the number of indicator lights
shown, but its indicator lights are all initially off.</p>
<p>So, an indicator light diagram like [.##.] means that the machine has four indicator
lights which are initially off and that the goal is to simultaneously configure the
first light to be off, the second light to be on, the third to be on, and the fourth
to be off.</p>
<p>You can toggle the state of indicator lights by pushing any of the listed buttons.
Each button lists which indicator lights it toggles, where 0 means the first light,
1 means the second light, and so on. When you push a button, each listed indicator
light either turns on (if it was off) or turns off (if it was on). You have to push
each button an integer number of times; there’s no such thing as “0.5 presses” (nor
can you push a button a negative number of times).</p>
<p>So, a button wiring schematic like (0,3,4) means that each time you push that
button, the first, fourth, and fifth indicator lights would all toggle between on
and off. If the indicator lights were [#…..], pushing the button would change them
to be […##.] instead.</p>
<p>Because none of the machines are running, the joltage requirements are irrelevant
and can be safely ignored.</p>
<p>You can push each button as many times as you like. However, to save on time, you
will need to determine the fewest total presses required to correctly configure all
indicator lights for all machines in your list.</p>
<p>There are a few ways to correctly configure the first machine:</p>
<div class="example-wrap"><pre class="language-text"><code>[.##.] (3) (1,3) (2) (2,3) (0,2) (0,1) {3,5,4,7}</code></pre></div>
<div class="example-wrap"><pre class="rust rust-example-rendered"><code>* You could press the first three buttons once each, a total of <span class="number">3 </span>button presses.
* You could press (<span class="number">1</span>,<span class="number">3</span>) once, (<span class="number">2</span>,<span class="number">3</span>) once, and (<span class="number">0</span>,<span class="number">1</span>) twice, a total of <span class="number">4 </span>button presses.
* You could press all of the buttons except (<span class="number">1</span>,<span class="number">3</span>) once each, a total of <span class="number">5 </span>button presses.</code></pre></div>
<p>However, the fewest button presses required is 2. One way to do this is by pressing
the last two buttons ((0,2) and (0,1)) once each.</p>
<p>The second machine can be configured with as few as 3 button presses:</p>
<div class="example-wrap"><pre class="language-text"><code>[...#.] (0,2,3,4) (2,3) (0,4) (0,1,2) (1,2,3,4) {7,5,12,7,2}</code></pre></div>
<p>One way to achieve this is by pressing the last three buttons ((0,4), (0,1,2), and
(1,2,3,4)) once each.</p>
<p>The third machine has a total of six indicator lights that need to be configured
correctly:</p>
<div class="example-wrap"><pre class="language-text"><code>[.###.#] (0,1,2,3,4) (0,3,4) (0,1,2,4,5) (1,2) {10,11,11,5,10,5}</code></pre></div>
<p>The fewest presses required to correctly configure it is 2; one way to do this is by
pressing buttons (0,3,4) and (0,1,2,4,5) once each.</p>
<p>So, the fewest button presses required to correctly configure the indicator lights
on all of the machines is 2 + 3 + 2 = 7.</p>
<p>Analyze each machine’s indicator light diagram and button wiring schematics. What is
the fewest button presses required to correctly configure the indicator lights on
all of the machines?</p>
<p>Your puzzle answer was 432.</p>
<h3 id="part-two"><a class="doc-anchor" href="#part-two">§</a>Part Two</h3>
<p>All of the machines are starting to come online! Now, it’s time to worry about the
joltage requirements.</p>
<p>Each machine needs to be configured to exactly the specified joltage levels to
function properly. Below the buttons on each machine is a big lever that you can use
to switch the buttons from configuring the indicator lights to increasing the
joltage levels. (Ignore the indicator light diagrams.)</p>
<p>The machines each have a set of numeric counters tracking its joltage levels, one
counter per joltage requirement. The counters are all initially set to zero.</p>
<p>So, joltage requirements like {3,5,4,7} mean that the machine has four counters
which are initially 0 and that the goal is to simultaneously configure the first
counter to be 3, the second counter to be 5, the third to be 4, and the fourth to be
7.</p>
<p>The button wiring schematics are still relevant: in this new joltage configuration
mode, each button now indicates which counters it affects, where 0 means the first
counter, 1 means the second counter, and so on. When you push a button, each listed
counter is increased by 1.</p>
<p>So, a button wiring schematic like (1,3) means that each time you push that button,
the second and fourth counters would each increase by 1. If the current joltage
levels were {0,1,2,3}, pushing the button would change them to be {0,2,2,4}.</p>
<p>You can push each button as many times as you like. However, your finger is getting
sore from all the button pushing, and so you will need to determine the fewest total
presses required to correctly configure each machine’s joltage level counters to
match the specified joltage requirements.</p>
<p>Consider again the example from before:</p>
<div class="example-wrap"><pre class="language-text"><code>[.##.] (3) (1,3) (2) (2,3) (0,2) (0,1) {3,5,4,7}
[...#.] (0,2,3,4) (2,3) (0,4) (0,1,2) (1,2,3,4) {7,5,12,7,2}
[.###.#] (0,1,2,3,4) (0,3,4) (0,1,2,4,5) (1,2) {10,11,11,5,10,5}</code></pre></div>
<p>Configuring the first machine’s counters requires a minimum of 10 button presses.
One way to do this is by pressing (3) once, (1,3) three times, (2,3) three times,
(0,2) once, and (0,1) twice.</p>
<p>Configuring the second machine’s counters requires a minimum of 12 button presses.
One way to do this is by pressing (0,2,3,4) twice, (2,3) five times, and (0,1,2)
five times.</p>
<p>Configuring the third machine’s counters requires a minimum of 11 button presses.
One way to do this is by pressing (0,1,2,3,4) five times, (0,1,2,4,5) five times,
and (1,2) once.</p>
<p>So, the fewest button presses required to correctly configure the joltage level
counters on all of the machines is 10 + 12 + 11 = 33.</p>
<p>Analyze each machine’s joltage requirements and button wiring schematics. What is
the fewest button presses required to correctly configure the joltage level counters
on all of the machines?</p>
